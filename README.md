# Etch-and-Sketch

A more update version of the old Etch N Sketch game that we all had as kids!

When you hover over a square it will fill in black and you can use it to make some pretty basic drawings.
The shade button will allow you to color a square in light grey and keep going over it to make it darker and darker.
The colors button will generate a random color and each time you go over the square it will get darker and darker
The reset button will reset all the squares back to white.
Also the grid button will allow you to choose the dimensions of the grid.
